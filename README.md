# Boxs

The new standard for inscribed assets. It leverages the unique ability of data to be parsed from multiple perspectives. Welcome to BOXS, a transformative metaverse standard leveraging the sol blockchain. Adopting ERC115+BRC20 changes, BOXS provides a new and groundbreaking way to bring rights to BOXS. This is a new frontier in the world of decentralized digital ownership and a new understanding of inscription infrastructure.

BOXS is a new consensus sta。。ndard that allows anyone to declare space digital assets

The platform can parse BOXS data into token realms and grant build access to block owners, creating a new paradigm for open source development. The ERC1155 protocol + BRC20 adopted by BOXS realizes the first token swap on SOL. BOXS is not a complete non-fungible token, but a semi-fungible token. BOX can be split into tokens, and tokens can also be synthesized into BOX. Note: BOX and token prices are not anchored, which will be interesting. Join the revolution

We invite you to join us on this exciting journey to build a truly open BOX. whether
