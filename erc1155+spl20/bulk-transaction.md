# Bulk transaction

In BOXS, multiple tokens can be sent in one transaction, which will save gas costs and prevent users from having to wait for each block in a single transaction. Projects using BOXS can also establish atomic swaps (similar to transactions, translator's note), which allow users to exchange two types of tokens absolutely safely, without fraud or third-party involvement.
