MakersPlace, the NFT platform that collaborated with Christie’s on the record-breaking auction of Beeple, also adopted a 15% commission mechanism. The same goes for SuperRare, which in addition to a relatively high fee (15%) has a lengthy artist qualification process that replicates the entry restrictions of traditional high-end auction houses.

Just as art dealers play the role of fashion trendsetters in the traditional art world, new ones are emerging in the NFT world. Digital art collector Pablo Rodriguez-Fraile spent $6.6 million to recreate "Crossroads," a 10-second NFT video of Trump lying on the ground.

He purchased this work for US$66,000 in October 2020. In just 5 months, his profit increased 100 times. Rodriguez-Fraile is also the co-founder of the Museum of Crypto-Art: an immersive virtual reality museum billed as “the best crypto-art museum in the metaverse.” Metakovan is the owner of the most expensive NFT piece (“First 5000 Days”), which sold for $69.3 million, and is the founder of Singapore-based Metapurse, a cryptocurrency-based investment firm whose mission is to “democratize access and ownership” of art. ” Metakovan funded the Metapalooza event, which featured 3Lau’s music, provided financial aid to artists, and provided funding for “storytellers.”

Hierarchies have quickly formed in the NFT world, and with power concentrated (and concentrated) in the hands of a few, trends about what can (and can't) be sold are likely to be defined by these new tastemakers.
