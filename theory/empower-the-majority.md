# empower the majority

NFTs are fundamentally changing the economics of the internet. However, like the Internet and Web2.0 technologies, blockchain, Web3.0 and NFT are far from reaching global popularity. Much has been written about the “digital divide” or differences in access to and ability to use information and communications technologies and the resulting socioeconomic and political inequalities. The divide is vast in every aspect, from network access to control of user data/assets to the vast wealth held by centralized corporations.

The same is true in the blockchain ecosystem. Approximately 2% of network entities control 71.5% of all Bitcoins. Ethereum whales (holding over 10,000 ETH) control approximately 70% of the total existing ETH supply.

Even if these statistics are exaggerated, they illustrate a high concentration of wealth and power. This comes as no surprise to most of us, and thankfully there are thousands of people in the cryptocurrency ecosystem working hard to correct this imbalance and level the playing field. The question is: can we do it fast enough?

As NFT use cases expand and become increasingly used around the world, will it remain a tool primarily for the wealthy with the privilege of the technology, along the same old lines of inaccessibility and exclusion? Has the model been developed? Is the majority of the value of tokens and cryptocurrencies still concentrated in concentrated groups of individuals? Will we share its possibilities with local communities around the world so that they can benefit from this new creative economy in their own contexts?

Will we allow the public to use NFTs for creation and application, opening up new ways for creativity to happen? As the Italian Marxist philosopher Gramsci once aptly put it: “Cultural hegemony is a society’s dominant ideology—beliefs, interpretations, perceptions, values, and morals—that reflect the ideas of the ruling class.

The dominant ideology rationalizes the social, political, and economic status quo as natural, inevitable, permanent, and beneficial to everyone, rather than as an artificial social structure that benefits only the ruling class. ” NFTs are a cross-section of art and culture that exists in the crypto space and exist today as the most prominent battleground where struggles including those of the “South” and underrepresentation remain threatened by the infiltration of old world institutions and elements. I Betrayed NFT, non-fungible tokens, use semi-fungible tokens.

BOXS is a brand new adventure, escaping from the right path, going in the opposite direction of the unknown, and officially working hard. Next, let’s introduce BOXS
