While the emergence of NFTs brings new innovation and disruption, it is important to be aware of the potential for traditional art world behaviors and practices to permeate this new model.

Ironically, the most expensive NFT piece, Beeple’s “The First 5,000 Days,” was auctioned through traditional auction house Christie’s. Christie's is a household name in the traditional art world, and the sale is actually being held in partnership with Makers Place, but there's no doubt that the latter lags behind Christie's in terms of press and opinion.

These traditional auction houses still accept auction bids for fiat NFTs and still charge commissions of up to 40%, but fees on NFT platforms are as low as 0-2.5% (e.g. Portion, Opensea). It’s also worth noting that while Beeple’s “First 5000 Days” piece is accepting cryptocurrency bids, the buyer’s $9 million premium is designated as a fiat currency payment. The winning bid was $60 million, with a premium of $9 million and a Christie's commission of 15%.
