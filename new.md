MakersPlace, the NFT platform that collaborated with Christie’s on Beeple’s record-breaking auction, also adopted a 15% commission mechanism. The same is true for SuperRare, which in addition to a relatively high fee (15%) has a lengthy artist qualification process that replicates the restrictive barriers to entry of traditional high-end auction houses. Just like art dealers who play the role of fashion trendsetters in the traditional art world, new equivalents have emerged in the NFT world. Digital art collector Pablo Rodriguez-Fraile paid $6.6 million for a remake of "Crossroad," a 10-second NFT video of Trump lying on the ground. This work was purchased by him for US$66,000 in October 2020. In just 5 months, the profit increased 100 times. Rodriguez-Fraile is also the co-founder of The Museum of Crypto Art: an immersive virtual reality museum billed as “the best crypto art museum in the Metaverse.” Metakovan, the owner of the most expensive NFT piece, which (“The First 5000 Days”) sold for $69.3 million, is the man behind Singapore-based Metapurse, a cryptocurrency-based investment firm whose mission is to “democratize access to and ownership of art.” Metakovan funded the Metapalooza event, which featured 3Lau's music, provided financial aid to artists and provided funding for "storytellers." A hierarchy is already forming rapidly in the NFT world, and as power is concentrated (and concentrated) in the hands of a few, trends about what can (and cannot be sold) are likely to be defined by these new tastemakers.
