Solana, the blockchain known for its high throughput and scalability, has introduced a revolutionary development in its NFT ecosystem – SPL-20 inscriptions.

SPL-20 inscription is a groundbreaking concept inspired by Bitcoin’s BRC-20 standard designed to facilitate the direct on-chain storage of digital art. Unlike traditional NFTs that rely on external platforms to store artwork, SPL-20 inscriptions provide a unique way for images to have their own on-chain address, providing greater integrity, permanence, and independence from any External storage limits.
