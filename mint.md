# Mint

2/Boxes is not a free Mint box. It costs 0.1 SOL per time. After Mint is completed, boxes sold for less than 0.1 SOL will be automatically purchased and destroyed by Boxes robots. 1 box can be divided into 1000 tokens, and 1000 tokens can be converted into 1 box. Note that the price of the box and the token are not anchored. They are different trading platforms, so will it become interesting? We will continue to update the document, please pay attention
