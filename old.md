While the emergence of NFTs has brought new innovations and disruptions, it is important to remain aware of the potential for behaviors and practices from the traditional art world to bleed into this new model. Ironically, the most expensive NFT piece, Beeple’s “The First 5000 Days,” was sold through traditional auction house Christie’s. Christie's is a household name in the traditional art world, and the sale was actually held in partnership with Makers Place, but there is no doubt that the latter lags behind Christie's in terms of news and public opinion. These traditional auction houses still accept auction bids for NFTs in fiat currencies and still charge commission fees of up to 40%, but fees on NFT platforms are as low as 0-2.5% (such as Portion, Opensea). It’s also worth noting that while Beeple’s “The First 5000 Days” piece accepts cryptocurrency bids, the buyer’s $9 million premium is designated as fiat currency payment. The winning bid closed at $60 million, with a premium of $9 million and Christie's fee of 15%.
